# CloudWalk's Backend Development Challenge: Ruby Book Library

## Scenario
Books are windows to different worlds. At CloudWalk, many of us are avid readers, and we often share book recommendations with each other. Imagine having a simple tool where team members can list books they recommend and also search for books based on certain criteria.

## Objective
Develop an API that allows team members to add books to a shared list and also query books based on specific parameters.

## Requirements

### Book Entry
- A book should have a title, author, genre, and publication year.

### Book Query
- Allow users to fetch a list of all books.
- Provide a search functionality where users can search for books based on title, author, or genre.

### Endpoint Creation
- Create endpoints for adding a book and querying books.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Before implementing each functionality, write tests to specify and validate what the code will do.
- For instance, before implementing the "add book" functionality, write a test to ensure a book can be added successfully.

## Instructions
1. Begin by writing tests for each piece of functionality (TDD approach).
2. Implement the functionality to make your tests pass.
3. Focus on clean, readable, and organized code.
4. Use Git for version control.
5. Provide instructions for setting up and testing the API locally.
6. Thorough documentation will assist us in evaluating and understanding the quality of your code.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality: Can books be added and queried effectively?
- TDD Adherence: Were tests written before implementation? Do they adequately test the API's capabilities?
- Code Quality: Is the code structured, readable, and does it follow best practices?

**Note:** This is an opportunity to showcase your foundational skills and your understanding of TDD. Take your time, think through your approach, and enjoy the process!

**Post Scriptum:** While you are welcome to complete this challenge in a programming language you're comfortable with, it's important to note that our primary language for development at CloudWalk is Ruby. Demonstrating your proficiency in Ruby would be a plus.
